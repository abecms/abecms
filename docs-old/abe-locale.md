## Config Abe

Set a property `siteLocaleFolder` to your `abe.json` file which link to your folder on your website source.

Exemple :

```javascript
{
    "siteLocaleFolder": "mylocales"
}
```

Under `mylocales` folder you can add a folder named `en-US` which is the default lang value or you can override this lang inside `abe.json` this way:

```javascript
{
    "intlData": {
        "locales": "fr-FR"
    }
}
```

After doing this you can add as many JSON files as you want inside `mylocales/fr-FR/` and the json key values will be merged with exsting locales values.
