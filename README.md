# AbeCMS

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/abecms/abecms.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

> AbeCMS is your __static websites generator__ with revolutionary __self-descriptive__ templates

When creating blogs becomes as easy as 1-2-3. A static site generator with a great back-office for users.

For agencies: Go 7X faster than with Wordpress or Drupal to create websites and blogs
For devs: A js full stack dev for js full stack devs with extensibility and efficiency in mind

- Markup your html templates with specific handlebars tags, and your back-office is ready to go: It's time to contribute for your users!
- Add a complete workflow of validation and permissions with ease, using the state of the art oAuth2 stack.
- Deploy automagically to AWS S3, Github.io, or any web server via SFTP
- Create multi-languages, multi-locales, complex web structures in no time
- Add plugins like abe-algolia, abe-elasticsearch... or create your own with just js skill

![From template abification to publication example](/tests/demo/site/images/abeCMS-demo.gif)

# Goals
- Being the easiest CMS on the planet for the developpers by providing 1 clear api stack to rule them all and using a html markup usable by non-devs to create a full website:
  - Develop your HTML templates with hot reload and see changes in real time
  - Develop your plugins with hor reload and see also changes in real time
  - Directory-based URLs. Create directories and subdirectories in AbeCMS, the URL page will be expressed from its spot on the filesystem.
  - Focus on your HTML integration, dynamizing it becomes a breeze with AbeCMS
- Being the easiest CMS on the planet for the users by using hyper clean pages and A REAL wysiwyg editor fast and easy to use:
  - One Dashboard for your analytics
  - One Manager page for listing and searching all your posts
  - One editor with a REAL wysiwyg of your post
  - One page for managing your users and their authorizations
  - THAT'S ALL !
- Being content focused (the C in CMS):
  - Data are created as JSON documents
  - An API-first Server to serve your documents as json
  - Or a static website generator
  - Or both !

# Why use AbeCMS instead of other CMS or Static Site Generators ?
- Designed for users
- A real Wysiwyg Editor
- A real workflow and authorization engine based on oAuth2
- Auto-generation of the back-office editor based on your markup
- Live editing on each part of your site during development dramatically increasing the dev speed
- A strong separation of data and templates making the reuse of data a breeze
- A API-first REST server: You create html pages and can consume data for your mobile, emails or whatever
